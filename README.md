## Algorithms Implemented in Python

### Quick Sort

The quick sort algorithm is utilized to efficiently sort an array of integers. As a demonstration of its functionality, let's consider finding the 3rd order statistic in a sorted array:

```
The 3rd order statistic in the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] is: 3
```

### Stack

A stack data structure is implemented to follow the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. In this example, we push some elements onto the stack, retrieve the top element, and then pop it:

```
Top of the stack: 3
Popped item: 3
Top of the stack after popping: 2
```

### Queue

The queue data structure follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. Here, we enqueue elements into the queue and then dequeue them:

```
Dequeued item: 1
Dequeued item: 2
```

### Singly Linked List

A singly linked list is implemented to store integers in a linear manner. After inserting elements into the list, we print its contents:

```
3 2 1
```

These implementations showcase fundamental algorithms and data structures in Python.
